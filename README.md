# The Interplay of Variant, Size, and Task Type in Arabic Pre-trained Language Models:

This repo contains code for the experiments in our paper [The Interplay of Variant, Size, and Task Type in Arabic Pre-trained Language Models]().

# Requirements:

This code was written for python>=3.7 and pytorch 1.5.1, although newer versions of pytorch might work just fine. You will need a few additional packages. Here's how you can set up the environment using conda (assuming you have conda and cuda installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balhafni/CAMeLBERT.git
cd CAMeLBERT

conda create -n CAMeLBERT python=3.7
conda activate CAMeLBERT

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
